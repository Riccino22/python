# Job Board
This Python script and Streamlit web app manage job seeker data efficiently. It integrates CSV for tag selection and JSON for storing seeker details. Users can input seeker information via a Streamlit form, selecting relevant tags from a CSV file (tags.csv). Upon submission, seeker details are stored in a JSON file (seekers.json), simplifying the process of managing and tracking job applicants.
